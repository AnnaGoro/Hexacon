## Synopsis

**Hexacon** is a new way to share your content in your app by make it look like your apple watch

Inspired by the work of [`lmmenge`](https://github.com/lmmenge/WatchSpringboard-Prototype)

### HexagonalViewDelegate & HexagonalViewDataSource

``` swift
protocol HexagonalViewDelegate: class {
    func hexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView, didSelectItemAtIndex index: Int)
}

public protocol HexagonalViewDataSource: class {
    func numberOfItemInHexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView) -> Int
    func hexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView,imageForIndex index: Int) -> UIImage?
    func hexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView,viewForIndex index: Int) -> UIView?
}

public extension HexagonalViewDataSource {
    func hexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView,imageForIndex index: Int) -> UIImage? { return nil }
    func hexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView,viewForIndex index: Int) -> UIView? { return nil }
}

```

## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Hexacon into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "gautier-gdx/Hexacon"
```

### Cocoapods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Hexacon into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
use_frameworks!

pod 'Hexacon'
```
