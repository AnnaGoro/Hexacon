## Synopsis

**Hexacon** is a new way to display content in your app like the Apple Watch SpringBoard

Inspired by the work of [`lmmenge`](https://github.com/lmmenge/WatchSpringboard-Prototype)

## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Hexacon into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "gautier-gdx/Hexacon"
```

### Cocoapods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Hexacon into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
use_frameworks!

pod 'Hexacon'
```
##Properties

The HexagonalView has the following properties:
```swift
weak var hexagonalDataSource: HexagonalViewDataSource?
```
An object that supports the HexagonalViewDataSource protocol and can provide views or images to configures the HexagonalView.
```swift
 weak var hexagonalDelegate: HexagonalViewDelegate?
```
An object that supports the HexagonalViewDelegate protocol and can respond to HexagonalView events.
```swift
public var lastFocusedViewIndex: Int 
```
The index of the view where the HexagonalView is or was centered on.
```swift
public var itemAppearance: HexagonalItemViewAppearance
```    
the appearance is used to configure the global apperance of the layout and the HexagonalItemVIew
dataSource method. 

### Methods

``` swift
func reloadData() 
```
This function load or reload all the view from the dataSource and refreshes the display
``` swift
func viewForIndex(index: Int) -> HexagonalItemView?
```
Return a view at given index if it exists

### Protocols

There is Two protocols in hexacon, HexagonalViewDataSource and  HexagonalViewDelegate

# dataSource

``` swift
func numberOfItemInHexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView) -> Int
```
Return the number of items the view will contain
``` swift
func hexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView,imageForIndex index: Int) -> UIImage?
```
Return a image to be displayed at index
``` swift
func hexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView,viewForIndex index: Int) -> UIView?
```
Return a view to be displayed at index

`NB: all of this methods are optional and you will have to choose whether you want to display a view or an image otherwise the image will be chosen in priority`

# delegate

``` swift
func hexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView, didSelectItemAtIndex index: Int)
```
This method is called when the user has selected a view
``` swift
func hexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView, willCenterOnIndex index: Int)
```
This method is called when the heaxagonal view will center on an item, it gives you the new value of lastFocusedViewIndex
