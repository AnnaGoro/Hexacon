## Synopsis

**Hexacon** is a new way to share your content in your app by make it look like your apple watch

Inspired by the work of [`lmmenge`](https://github.com/lmmenge/WatchSpringboard-Prototype)

### HexagonalViewDelegate & HexagonalViewDataSource

``` swift
protocol HexagonalViewDelegate: class {
func hexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView, didSelectItemAtIndex index: Int)
}

public protocol HexagonalViewDataSource: class {
func numberOfItemInHexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView) -> Int
func hexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView,imageForIndex index: Int) -> UIImage?
func hexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView,viewForIndex index: Int) -> UIView?
}

public extension HexagonalViewDataSource {
func hexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView,imageForIndex index: Int) -> UIImage? { return nil }
func hexagonalView(hexagonalView: HexagonalView,viewForIndex index: Int) -> UIView? { return nil }
